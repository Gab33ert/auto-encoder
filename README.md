There are 4 scripts for launching the 3 models.

1 autoencoder_random_notspatial.py for the first one that is an auto encoder with handcrafted layers from neural gas (2d neural gas is generated, then left neurons are associated to input, middle one to intermediate layers and left one to output layer)

2 spatial_auto.py Completly spatial autoencoder trained on polynomials.

spatial_auto_MNIST.py Completly spatial autoencoder on Mnist

3 3d_spatial_MNIST_rbm.py Launch the deep belief network. Can train different networks, and save/load different already trained networks.
